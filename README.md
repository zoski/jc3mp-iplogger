# jc3mp-iplogger
A small package that log players IP to a log file and display a ligne in the server terminal. I use it to create a temporary whitelist during DDOS.

## Install
1. Go to your **packages** directory
2. git clone https://github.com/zoski/jc3mp-iplogger.git iplogger
3. Go to your server terminal and `restart_package iplogger`

  You should see something like that : `[IPL]: IPlogger started...`
4. Enjoy... You will find a new file in the **logs** named : **IPlogger.log**

## Extending
Feel free to extend and fork this small package. For now all the IP of every player connecting is put in the log file.
